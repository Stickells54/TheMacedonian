# The Macedonian: Rise of the Usurper

A Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord mod inspired by Basil I of Byzantium that adds deep political intrigue mechanics, allowing players to scheme, conspire, and ultimately seize the throne of their kingdom.

## Overview

In 9th century Byzantium, Basil I rose from nothing to become Emperor through a combination of loyal service, careful scheming, and ruthless action. This mod brings that political gameplay to Bannerlord, allowing you to:

- **Serve as the Right Hand** - Become the ruler's most trusted advisor through loyal military service
- **Build a Conspiracy** - Recruit fellow lords to support your claim to power
- **Eliminate Rivals** - Use various methods to remove obstacles in your path
- **Manage Suspicion** - Balance ambition against the risk of exposure
- **Seize the Throne** - Execute a coup when the time is right
- **Maintain Legitimacy** - Survive as ruler through the dangerous post-coronation period

## Features

### The Right Hand System
- **Battle Tracking** - Fight 3+ victorious battles alongside your ruler
- **Petition Dialog** - Request to become Royal Protector when requirements are met
- **Companion Hostage** - Send a trusted companion to serve at the ruler's court
- **Requirements** - Clan Tier 3+, Relation 30+, companion available
- **Benefits** - Renown, Charm XP, access to intrigue options

### Conspiracy System
- Recruit disaffected lords to your cause
- Track **Coup Strength** (percentage of kingdom military power supporting you)
- Manage **Leak Risk** - more conspirators means more danger
- Buy silence from those who learn too much

### Assassination Methods
Four distinct approaches, each with unique mechanics:

| Method | Style | Key Skills | Risk |
|--------|-------|------------|------|
| **Poison** | Subtle | Medicine, Charm | Low detection, high preparation |
| **Hunting Accident** | Opportunistic | Riding, Roguery | Requires target to hunt |
| **Duel Provocation** | Direct | Combat skills | Many witnesses |
| **Midnight Dagger** | Bold | Roguery, Athletics | High risk, high reward |

### Framing System
- Frame rival clans for assassinations
- Blame enemy kingdoms to start wars
- Attribute deaths to bandits

### Suspicion & Legitimacy
- **Suspicion** - The ruler and court's awareness of your scheming
- **Legitimacy** - Your claim to power after taking the throne (0-100)
- Actions have consequences that ripple through your reign

3. **Emergent Stories** - Systems interact to create unique narratives
4. **Historical Inspiration** - Mechanics reflect real political intrigue
